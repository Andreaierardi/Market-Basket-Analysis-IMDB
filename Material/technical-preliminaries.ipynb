Clicking on that section of the tab will show you some more details, and in particular you'll notice that VMs are named «amd-cluster-m», «amd-cluster-w0», and «amd-cluster-w1» in order to differentiate between master and workers. You can ssh into these instances, again clicking on the «SSH» button or using a terminal as follows. "

If you check the detailed charges, however, you will notice that the resources we used have actually been accounted for, although they were used for so small a time that we did not incur in any cost charge. Note nonetheless that the shown charges only represent an estimate, thus take the habit of periodically control the effective costs which have been charged on your account."

Moreover, despite the fact that this virtual machine has a remarkable computational power (it can be boosted using GPUs or TPUs), it could represent an insufficient resource for dealing with complex problems. When a more reliable computing environment is needed and the Colab frontend can be hosted on a machine provided by us, for instance a VM spinned up using GCP, as previously explained.
